# TicketingSystem

## Ticketing System in C++
This application is a small Ticket System (which is still WIP) that allows you to buy a ticket (for a bus, train, tram) for half an hour or one hour.
When you buy a ticket a Barcode is generated for each ticket (WIP) and each ticket gets its unique ID.

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Ticketing System, designed to streamline and manage the ticketing process for buses, trains and trams. 
The Barcode Generator system allows you for easier ticket validation when a conducter needs to check if your ticket is valid.

## Features
User-friendly Interface: Intuitive command-line interface for easy navigation and interaction. (WIP - in process of finding quality framework to implement the code on)
Ticket Creation: Create, view, and manage tickets with essential details and status tracking.
